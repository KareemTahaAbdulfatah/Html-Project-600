        <h1 style=" text-align:center;">  Introduction </h1>
        <p>
            Modern computers are incredibly fast, and getting faster all the time. However, computers also have some significant constraints: they only natively understand a limited set of commands, and must be told exactly what to do. 
A computer program (also commonly called an application) is a set of instructions that the computer can perform in order to perform some task. The process of creating a program is called programming. Programmers typically create programs by producing source code (commonly shortened to code), which is a list of commands typed into one or more text files. 
The collection of physical computer parts that make up a computer and execute programs is called the hardware. When a computer program is loaded into memory and the hardware sequentially executes each instruction, this is called running or executing the program. 
A computer’s CPU is incapable of speaking C++. The limited set of instructions that a CPU can understand directly is called machine code (or machine language or an instruction set). 
Here is a sample machine language instruction: 10110000 01100001 
Back when computers were first invented, programmers had to write programs directly in machine language, which was a very difficult and time consuming thing to do. 
How these instructions are organized is beyond the scope of this introduction, but it is interesting to note two things. First, each instruction is composed of a sequence of 1’s and 0’s. Each individual 0 or 1 is called a binary digit, or bit for short. The number of bits that make up a single command vary -- for example, some CPUs process instructions that are always 32 bits long, whereas some other CPUs (such as the x86 family, which you are likely using) have instructions that can be a variable length. 
Second, each set of binary digits is interpreted by the CPU into a command to do a very specific job, such as compare these two numbers, or put this number in that memory location. However, because different CPUs have different instruction sets, instructions that were written for one CPU type could not be used on a CPU that didn’t share the same instruction set. This meant programs generally weren’t portable (usable without major rework) to different types of system, and had to be written all over again. 
Because machine language is so hard for humans to read and understand, assembly language was invented. In an assembly language, each instruction is identified by a short abbreviation (rather than a set of bits), and names and other numbers can be used. 
Here is the same instruction as above in assembly language: mov al, 061h 
This makes assembly much easier to read and write than machine language. However, the CPU can not understand assembly language directly. Instead, the assembly program must be translated into machine language before it can be executed by the computer. This is done by using a program called an assembler. Programs written in assembly languages tend to be very fast, and assembly is still used today when speed is critical.

      <h4>(1)What is Programming Language?</h4>
      <p> 
A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks. The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages, such as BASIC, C, C++, COBOL, Java, FORTRAN, Ada, and Pascal.Each programming language has a unique set of keywords (words that it understands) and a special syntax for organizing program instructions. 
 
Computer programming language, any of various languages for expressing a set of detailed instructions for a digital computer. Such instructions can be executed directly when they are in the computer manufacturer-specific numerical form known as machine language, after a simple substitution process when expressed in a corresponding assembly language, or after translation from some “higher-level” language. Although there are many computer languages, relatively few are widely used. 
A PL must be universal – capable of expressing any computation. 
 – A language without iteration or recursion would not be universal. 
 – The lambda calculus – a language of recursive functions and nothing else – is universal.  
      </p>
      
      <h4>(2) What is a programming language? </h4>
<p>
A PL should be reasonably natural for expressing computations in its intended area. 
 – C is natural for systems programming. 
 – Java is natural for applications. –  
Python is natural for scripting. 
A PL must be implementable: 
 – it must be possible to run every program in that PL on a computer. 
 – as long as the computer has enough memory. 
 A PL should be capable of reasonably efficient implementation.
  – Running a program should not require an unreasonable amount of time or memory. 
 – What is reasonable depends on the context. E.g., Python is slow, but acceptable for scripting applications; it would not be acceptable for systems. 
Syntax and semantics: 
The syntax of a PL is concerned with the form of programs: how expressions, commands, declarations, and other constructs must be arranged to make a well-formed program.  
The semantics of a PL is concerned with the meaning of well-formed programs:  
how a program may be expected to behave when run on a machine.  
 Semantics underlies all programming, and language implementation. Syntax provides a structure on which semantics can be defined. 
   <h5>(1)Design concepts:</h5> 
Design concepts are the building blocks of PLs: 
values and types – variables and storage – bindings and scope – procedural abstraction – data abstraction – generic abstraction – processes and communication (not covered here). 
    <h5>(2)Design concepts:</h5>  
A paradigm is a style of programming, characterized by a selection of key concepts. 
 – Functional programming focuses on values, expressions, and functions. 
 – Imperative programming focuses on variables, commands (“statements”), and procedures. 
 – Object-oriented (OO) programming focuses on objects, methods, and classes.
 – Concurrent programming focuses on processes and communication. 
 Understanding of design concepts and paradigms enables us to select PLs for a project.

        <h4 style="  font-size:30px;">(3)The Top Programming Languages?</h4>
        <p style="font-size:30px;">
         According to IEEE Spectrum's interactive ranking, Python is the top programming language of 2017, followed by C, Java and C++. Of course, the choice of which language to use depends on the type of computer the program is to run on, what sort of program it is, and the expertise of the programmer.
